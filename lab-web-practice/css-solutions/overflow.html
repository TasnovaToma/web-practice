    <div class="container">
        <div class="box visible-box">
            <h2>Overflow: visible</h2>
            <p>This is a fixed-size box (300px wide, 200px high) to demonstrate overflow handling. The content inside this box is intentionally long to exceed the boundaries. When set to **visible**, the content simply spills out of the container and overlaps the surrounding elements without showing scrollbars. The container's border only encloses the set dimensions, not the spilling text.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box hidden-box">
            <h2>Overflow: hidden</h2>
            <p>This is a fixed-size box (300px wide, 200px high) to demonstrate overflow handling. The content inside this box is intentionally long to exceed the boundaries. When set to **hidden**, any content that exceeds the box's defined borders is simply clipped or cut off. Scrollbars are never shown, and the overflowing content is entirely invisible to the user.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box scroll-box">
            <h2>Overflow: scroll</h2>
            <p>This is a fixed-size box (300px wide, 200px high) to demonstrate overflow handling. The content inside this box is intentionally long to exceed the boundaries. When set to **scroll**, the box displays both horizontal and vertical scrollbars, regardless of whether the content is actually overflowing in both directions. This ensures the user knows they *can* scroll to view all content.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box auto-box">
            <h2>Overflow: auto</h2>
            <p>This is a fixed-size box (300px wide, 200px high) to demonstrate overflow handling. The content inside this box is intentionally long to exceed the boundaries. When set to **auto**, the browser only displays a scrollbar if the content actually overflows in that direction. This is often the preferred and most flexible choice, as it uses screen space efficiently by hiding unnecessary scrollbars.</p>
